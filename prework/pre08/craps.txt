I programmed this in Snap!, because I wanted to make it a bit showier.  I wanted to animate the dice, but I found that I didn't know how to do that while meeting the criteria--ie, making roll and shoot generalized for any number of dice.  I ended up using a lot of global variables, which I didn't really like, but I do have the main, roll, shoot and round methods written with the same basic logic as they would be in Java. Here is a link to the shared Snap! file.  Press the green flag to play:  https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=sarah%20mccoy&ProjectName=Craps%20V1.1--per%20requirement
