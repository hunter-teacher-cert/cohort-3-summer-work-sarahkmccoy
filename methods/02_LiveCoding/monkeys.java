//Live code that creates 5 little monkeys in in the bed song

//Working code

// public static void main(String[] args){
// 	for (int i = 5; i >0; i--)
// 	{
// 		System.out.println(i + " little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell out and bumped his head, mama called the doctor and the doctor said: ");
// 		System.out.println("NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!");

//MESSED UP CODE
public class monkeys
{
//before showing anything except line 25, ask what structure we could use to generate the song (possible discussion of while loop vs. for i loop--while loop is better for when we aren't sure when the iteration should end, but in this case it's very clear, so use for i loop--we know where we start, and we know where we end...then show line 26 structure
public static void main(String[] args){
//Here's the for i loop structure..elicit the values we should plug in.  Expect struggle/discussion around decrementing vs. incrementing (i--)
	for (int i =___ ; i >__; i__)
	{
		//How do I use this loop in this song? (before showing the following)
		System.out.println(????
			//line breaks?  All one big print?--this could be an opportunity for revision...or what happens when there are no more monkeys--code in an exception--grammatical error in 1 little monkey--how do you skip a line
	}
